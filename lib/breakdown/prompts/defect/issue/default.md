It's messy. Need to organize.
1. --version should work.
2. examples/*.sh worked.
3. Doesn't work after installation.

Hypothesis
1. There are multiple CLI installation methods, with working and non-working patterns
2. CLI installation instructions explain methods that don't work
3. CLI installation preparation is needed but not documented
4. There's a bug in the implementation
5. Examples have special pre-preparation that implementation alone can't handle

Consider other possible hypotheses from a. documents, b. examples, c. implementation, d. installed environment perspectives

Confirmed specifications:
- Documentation under docs/ other than installation instructions

What to do:
Understand the problem. Create files in tmp/ and record investigation results
