# User Authentication System Implementation

## Issue Description
Implement a secure, scalable user authentication system for the e-commerce platform that supports multiple authentication methods and provides robust session management.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **User Registration**
   - Email-based registration with email verification
   - Password strength validation
   - Optional social media registration (Google, Facebook)
   - User profile creation with basic information

2. **User Login**
   - Email/password authentication
   - Social media authentication
   - "Remember me" functionality
   - Account lockout after failed attempts

3. **Password Management**
   - Secure password reset via email
   - Password change functionality
   - Password history to prevent reuse
   - Expired password notifications

4. **Session Management**
   - JWT token-based authentication
   - Refresh token mechanism
   - Session timeout handling
   - Multi-device session support

### Technical Requirements
1. **Security**
   - bcrypt password hashing
   - CSRF protection
   - Rate limiting for authentication endpoints
   - Input validation and sanitization
   - Secure HTTP-only cookies

2. **Database**
   - User table with encrypted PII
   - Session/token storage
   - Audit logging for authentication events
   - Database connection pooling

3. **API Design**
   - RESTful authentication endpoints
   - Consistent error responses
   - API documentation with examples
   - Health check endpoints

### Performance Requirements
- Authentication response time < 500ms
- Support 1000+ concurrent login attempts
- Token refresh without user interruption
- Efficient session cleanup

### Compliance
- GDPR compliance for user data
- Password policy enforcement
- Data retention policies
- Audit trail for security events

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] User can register with email and password
- [ ] Email verification is required before account activation
- [ ] User can login with verified credentials
- [ ] Failed login attempts are tracked and limited
- [ ] Password reset functionality works end-to-end
- [ ] JWT tokens are properly generated and validated
- [ ] Session expires after configured timeout
- [ ] User can logout and invalidate session
- [ ] All authentication endpoints have proper error handling
- [ ] Security headers are implemented
- [ ] Rate limiting prevents brute force attacks
- [ ] All user data is encrypted at rest
- [ ] Audit logs capture authentication events

## Dependencies
- Database schema design completion
- Email service configuration
- Redis cache setup for session storage
- SSL certificate installation

## Estimated Effort
**Total**: 3-4 weeks (120-160 hours)

## Priority
**High** - Blocking for all user-facing features
