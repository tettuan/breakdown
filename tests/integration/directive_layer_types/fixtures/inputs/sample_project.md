# E-Commerce Platform Modernization Project

## Project Overview
We need to modernize our legacy e-commerce platform to improve performance, user experience, and maintainability. The current system is built on outdated technology and struggles with scalability issues.

## Current State
- **Platform**: Legacy PHP monolith (10+ years old)
- **Database**: MySQL 5.7 with performance bottlenecks
- **Frontend**: Server-rendered HTML with minimal JavaScript
- **Infrastructure**: Single server deployment
- **Monthly Traffic**: 100k+ users, 10k+ orders

## Goals
1. **Performance**: Reduce page load times by 50%
2. **Scalability**: Support 10x current traffic
3. **User Experience**: Modern, responsive interface
4. **Maintainability**: Modular, testable codebase
5. **Mobile**: Mobile-first design approach

## Scope
### In Scope
- User authentication and authorization
- Product catalog and search
- Shopping cart and checkout flow
- Order management system
- Payment processing integration
- Admin dashboard for content management
- Mobile responsive design
- API development for future integrations

### Out of Scope
- Data migration from legacy system (separate project)
- Third-party integrations beyond payment
- Advanced analytics (future phase)

## Technical Requirements
- **Backend**: Node.js with TypeScript, microservices architecture
- **Frontend**: React with Next.js for SSR
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Redis for caching
- **Infrastructure**: Docker containers on AWS with auto-scaling
- **Testing**: 80%+ code coverage, automated testing pipeline
- **Security**: OAuth2, HTTPS everywhere, input validation

## Business Constraints
- **Timeline**: 6 months for MVP
- **Budget**: $200k development budget
- **Team**: 4 developers, 1 designer, 1 DevOps engineer
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime requirement
- **Compliance**: PCI DSS for payment processing

## Success Metrics
- Page load time < 2 seconds
- Mobile Core Web Vitals score > 90
- Zero critical security vulnerabilities
- 95%+ user satisfaction score
- Successful handling of Black Friday traffic (3x normal load)
