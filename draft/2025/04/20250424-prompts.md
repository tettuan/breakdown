Start "implementation improvement" after completing "specification understanding."

# Mission: Creating Prompts
Consider application prompt content and save as initial prompts.

# Specification Understanding

Read all specification documents referenced from `docs/index.md` and `docs/breakdown/index.md`. Schema specification understanding is not required.
Especially `docs/breakdown/app_prompt.md` explains prompt processing. Essential for knowing where to place which prompts.

## Use Case: Prompt Selection Logic
Read the project README to understand use cases.
The combination when two parameters are passed determines the prompt.

# Implementation Improvement
1. Determine the number of prompts that need to be created based on use case parameter combinations
2. Understand save location specifications and decide save destinations for each prompt
3. Write prompts while being aware of characteristic differences
4. Define variables to embed template and output destination information in prompts
5. Brush up prompt content against objectives
