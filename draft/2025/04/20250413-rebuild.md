Read all specification documents referenced from `docs/index.md` and `docs/breakdown/index.md`.

Then perform the following processes.

# Existing Implementation Necessity Assessment

- While reading the implementation, comment on parts that differ from specifications.
  - Don't change implementation yet.
  - Also note comment locations in `tmp/changes.md`
- While reading tests, comment on parts that differ from specifications.
  - Note comment locations in `tmp/changes.md`
- Read `tmp/changes.md` comprehensively and imagine the optimal application image
- Write modification proposals in `tmp/rebuild.md` to match the imagined image
  - Write the overall picture, then write the change order
  - Write contextually and explanatorily so humans can understand
