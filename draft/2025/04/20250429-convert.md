Perform "conversion processing test implementation" after conducting "specification understanding" for the "mission."

# Mission: Establishing prompts Conversion Processing
Based on specifications, perform variable substitution processing of prompt files in BreakdownPrompt

# Specification Understanding

Read all specification documents referenced from `docs/index.md` and `docs/breakdown/index.md`. Schema specification understanding is not required.
Especially `docs/breakdown/path.md`, `docs/breakdown/app_prompt.md` explain information necessary for prompt processing.

## Use Case: Prompt Selection Logic
Read the project README to understand use cases.

# Conversion Processing Test Implementation
1. Extract prompt processing tests under tests/
2. Compare extracted tests with specification document processing
3. Incorporate specification-based processing into code under test
4. Proceed to "Execute main code implementation improvement"

## Execute Main Code Implementation Improvement
1. Execute `scripts/local_ci.sh`
2. For errors, understand CursorRules, `docs/breakdown/testing.md`
3. Add debug logs to tests. Add BreakdownLogger output before and after test code at error locations.
4. Execute `scripts/local_ci.sh` again
5. If there are unclear points or ambiguities, search for specification documents starting from `docs/`, read them, and derive solutions.
6. Return to the first step
