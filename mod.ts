// This file intentionally omits module-level documentation (such as @module JSDoc)
// to allow the README.md to be used as the "Overview" in JSR documentation.
// See: https://jsr.io/docs/packages#documentation
//
// For full documentation and usage, refer to the README.md at the root of this repository.
//
// Purpose: This approach ensures that the JSR package overview is sourced from the README,
// providing richer and more maintainable documentation for users.

// Export only the CLI entry point
