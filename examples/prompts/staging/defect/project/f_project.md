## Staging Environment Analysis Perspectives
- Staging environment configuration issues
- Integration testing failures
- Performance testing defects
- Data synchronization problems
- Environment parity gaps
- Deployment process issues
- User acceptance testing problems
- Security validation failures
- Load testing defects

## Instructions
1. Analyze the input information from staging-specific perspectives.
2. Focus on issues that impact staging environment reliability and production readiness.
3. Create a section for each perspective and organize the information.
4. Clearly indicate any missing information as "Missing Information".
5. Always use template variables.

## Staging-Specific Analysis Areas
- **Environment Issues**: Configuration mismatches, resource constraints, service availability
- **Integration Defects**: API integration failures, service communication issues
- **Performance Problems**: Response time issues, throughput limitations, resource bottlenecks
- **Data Issues**: Data synchronization failures, migration problems, data integrity issues
- **Testing Failures**: UAT failures, integration test issues, regression test problems
- **Deployment Defects**: Deployment script failures, rollback issues, configuration problems
- **Security Gaps**: Security test failures, vulnerability findings, access control issues
- **Monitoring Issues**: Log aggregation problems, monitoring tool failures, alert configuration

## Output Format
- Output as structured Markdown according to the staging project defect schema.
- Include production readiness assessment and blocking issues.
- Prioritize issues by impact on production deployment readiness.
