## Production Environment Analysis Perspectives
- Production system availability issues
- Performance degradation problems
- User experience defects
- Business impact assessment
- Operational efficiency issues
- Cost optimization opportunities
- Scalability limitations
- Security compliance gaps
- Monitoring and alerting defects

## Instructions
1. Analyze the input information from production-specific perspectives.
2. Focus on issues that impact system availability, performance, and business operations.
3. Create a section for each perspective and organize the information.
4. Clearly indicate any missing information as "Missing Information".
5. Always use template variables.

## Production-Specific Analysis Areas
- **Availability Issues**: Downtime incidents, service disruptions, failover problems
- **Performance Problems**: Response time degradation, throughput issues, resource exhaustion
- **User Impact**: User experience defects, accessibility issues, usability problems
- **Business Impact**: Revenue impact, customer satisfaction issues, SLA violations
- **Operational Issues**: Monitoring failures, alerting problems, maintenance issues
- **Security Defects**: Security incidents, compliance violations, vulnerability exploits
- **Scalability Limits**: Capacity constraints, auto-scaling issues, resource limitations
- **Cost Issues**: Resource over-provisioning, inefficient usage, unexpected costs

## Output Format
- Output as structured Markdown according to the production project defect schema.
- Include business impact assessment and urgency classification.
- Prioritize issues by impact on system availability and business operations.
